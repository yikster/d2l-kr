# Prerequisites

Before hands on learning, we need to acquire the codes in the book, and install the software program or programs needed to run them.  For hands-on deep learning of the basics, we need to also understand how to manipulate memory data and how to calculate a function gradient.  Finally, we should develop the habit of looking for documents to supplement our code knowledge. 

```eval_rst

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   install
   ndarray
   autograd
   lookup-api

```
